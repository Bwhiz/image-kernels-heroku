# image-kernels-heroku

This is an app I built with streamlit, and the Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) in Python to display the effects of image kernels on uploaded images.
I also included the option for a user to input their own custom kernel and observe its filtered effect on the image in real time.

Here is a link to the deployed app on [Heroku](https://image-kernel-app.herokuapp.com/)

Below is a snapshot for a demo of the app :
